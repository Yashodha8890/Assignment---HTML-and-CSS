    <p class = "importantText">Apple has begun making payments in a long-running class action lawsuit over claims it deliberately slowed down certain iPhones in the US.</p>

    <p>Complainants will receive a cut of a $500m (£394m) settlement <b><a class = "importantLink" href="https://twitter.com/mbrkhrdt/status/1743663751146946929">which works out to around $92 (£72) per claim.</a></b></p>
    
    <p>Apple agreed to settle the lawsuit in 2020, stating at the time it denied any wrongdoing but was concerned with the cost of continuing litigation.</p>

    <p>A similar case under way in the UK is seeking £1.6bn in compensation.</p>

    <p>The US case dates back to December 2017, when Apple confirmed a long-held suspicion among phone owners <a class = "importantLink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42438745">by admitting it had deliberately slowed down some iPhones as they got older.</a></p>

    <p>It said that as batteries aged, their performance decreased, and so the "slowdown" lengthened the phones' lifespan.</p>

    <p>But it was accused of throttling the performance of certain iPhones without telling its customers, and the uproar resulted in Apple offering a cut-price battery replacement to fix the problem.</p>

    <p>It led to the US legal action. At the time of the settlement, it was estimated that each person might receive as little as $25 each but the actual pay-out appears to be almost four times that sum.</p>

    <p>In the UK, Apple lost a bid to block a similar mass action lawsuit last November.</p>

    <p>The case, <a class = "importantLink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61823512">first brought by Justin Gutmann in June 2022</a>, represents an estimated 24 million iPhone users.</p>

    <p>Apple has previously called the lawsuit "baseless" and said "we have never - and would never - do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades".</p>

    <p>Mr Gutmann told the BBC he was pleased to hear about payments being made in the US, but warned it does not have any bearing on the UK case.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't advance our position here, they haven't admitted anything - they've settled," he said.</p>

    <p>"It's a moral victory but not much use to me. I've got to plough on and pursue the case in the UK jurisdiction."</p>

    <p>He said Apple was "fighting tooth and nail" against the UK class action, which will next appear at the Court of Appeal who will consider a call from the firm to halt the case.</p>

    <p>He said it was difficult to put a timeline on what would come next but hopes it will go to trial in late 2024 or early 2025.</p>
